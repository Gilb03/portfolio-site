I started my career \n     at BLUE KABOOM as an Inbound Marketing Consultant and KROGER as a digital experience\n     associate. I moved to Chicago to go back to school and while I learn, I also work on \n     helping companies win their digital goals. \n\n        Outside of work, I capture joy and comraderie through my Instagram games and inspirational\n          posts. I am a part-time snacktivist, full time grad student, and on the weekends I mix podcasts\n     and remix hip-hop/house songs. \n\n    </p>\n    <style jsx>{`\n        .elevator {\n          text-align: center;\n        }\n        p {\n          margin-bottom:10px;\n          font-weight: bold;\n          font-size: 30px;\n          border-radius: 50%;\n        }\n      `}</style></div>\n    \n)\nexport default About"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAFA;AAAA;AADA;AACA;AA2BA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
