    <p>
        During the day I assist companies in transforming various data point relationships
     into meaningful strategy for fueling their digital campaigns. I started my career 
     at BLUE KABOOM as an Inbound Marketing Consultant and KROGER as a digital experience
     associate. I moved to Chicago to go back to school and while I learn, I also work on 
     helping companies win their digital goals. Outside of work, I capture joy and comraderie 
     through my Instagram games and inspirational posts. I am a part-time snacktivist, 
     full time grad student, and on the weekends I mix podcasts and remix hip-hop/house songs.
