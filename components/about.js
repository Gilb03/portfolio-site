    <p>
        During the day I assist companies in transforming various data points into 
        meaningful strategies for fueling digital campaigns among other things. I started my career 
     at Blue Kaboom as an Inbound Marketing Consultant. I later moved to Chicago to go back to school( Go DIBS!).
     Outside of work, I capture joy and comraderie through games and inspirational Instagram posts. 
     I am a part-time snacktivist, full time grad student, and on the weekends I study, mix podcasts, and remix hip-hop/house music.
